## Introduction
Recently, several managers, including two time UCL winners José Mourinho of Manchester United and Carlo Ancelloti of Napoli, as well as former Spain head coach Julen Lopetegui currently at Real Madrid, Juventus man and two time finalist Massimiliano Allegri, and Arsène Wenger formerly at Arsenal have called for a review of the away goal. Giorgia Marchetti,deputy general secratery of UEFA has confirmed that UEFA will "open a discussion" concerning the rule. Many coaches believe that it is no longer as difficult to score away from home [1]. After listening to the Guardian Football Weekly with Max, Barry, and Ellis bring it up, I decided to spend the international break wisely and take a look at the numbers.

### The Rule
The away goal is currently used for breaking ties in many Football competitions, including in the UEFA Champions League. According to FIFA's Law of the game, "Competition  rules  may  provide  that  where  teams  play  each  other  
home and away, if the scores are equal after the second match, any 
goals scored at the ground of the opposing team will count double." [2]. 

In simpler terms, by the final whistle of normal time of the second game in a tie and both teams are level on goals, if one team has scored more goals away from home than the other, they will advance. If both teams are still tied, then they will advance to extra time.

### History and Impact
The away goal rule was first introduce by UEFA in the 1965 UEFA Cup Winners Cup [3]. Recently, it has not been overly influential. Since the begining of the knock out legs in the 1994-95 UEFA Champions League, only one team has ever benefitted from the rule, and gone on to win the competition. This was German side FC Bayern München during the 2012-13 season where they met Arsenal in the round of 16 [4]. 

## A Look at the Numbers

### The Data
I collected the data for all knock out games since the 1994-95 season of the Champions League. I began here as this is where they began having knock out rounds, with the top 8 teams from the group stages making up the quarter finals, and a total of 12 games. With the 2003-04 season, a further 8 teams were added to the knock out stages, expanding it to 28 games played. The data was compiled using LibreOffice Calc. 

### The Count
Whilst the total count does not show us anything particuraly insightful, it is a good visulisation clearly showing the goals, and the obvious increase from the 2003-04 season.
