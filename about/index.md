Hello. My name is Adam, I'm an aspiring software engineer based in Melbourne, Australia. Recently I completed a BCS degree at Swinburne University of Technology. I have a passion for all things computing, particularly open source software development. Outside of computer science, I enjoy traveling, literature, motor mechanics, and am an avid Chelsea FC supporter.
